Little OS
=========

[Littel OS Book][littleosbook] is a practical guide to writing
your own x86 operating system. It is designed to give enough help
with the technical details while at the same time not reveal
too much with samples and code excerpts.

It foucs on writing kernel and drivers. It just uses grub as
the bootloader.

Our repo will complete the code in this book.
